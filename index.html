								<span class="image left"><img src="images/phillipscheepers.jpg" alt="Phillip Scheepers" /></span>
								<p>Dr Phillip Scheepers is the vice-principal of the Reformed Theological Seminary in Geelong, Australia where he lectures on Missions and Church History.</p>
								<p>After his training in the ministry in South Africa, he worked in mission work locally before moving to London. He was there for 8 years working for Veritas College, where he established training ministries for local church leaders in the Arab world.</p>
								<p>In 2007 he moved to Australia in order to secure support for the Veritas training program and joined the Reformed Theological College in 2010.</p>
								<p>Phillip is going to be speaking to us about &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; as we consider the place of Christianity in our modern society, and how this impacts on who we are in relation to God, ourselves and others. Without a real grounding in Biblical truth we are simply cast adrift and tossed in all directions, which is something we see all around us today! The truth about God and our Lord is directly relevant to every aspect of our lives.</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Truth as God&rsquo;s Truth:</strong> An overview of Biblical teaching on truth and why we can trust God&rsquo;s Word as true.<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Truth and the Self:</strong> How does God&rsquo;s truth impact how we view ourselves, i.e. a &lsquo;biblical anthropology&rsquo;, how does this differ from society&rsquo;s views of personhood. Why the Biblical view makes sense and some areas of practical application.<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Truth and Relationships:</strong> What does the Bible say about how we interact with one another? How the pursuit of your potential leads to &lsquo;a war of all against all&rsquo; and how Biblical truth can be a powerful corrective to this - i.e. love and serve one another<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Truth and Society:</strong> Answering the &lsquo;so what&rsquo; question. How does believing in Biblical truth impact the way in which we view and seek to transform our society. How can we do this?<br>

								<h3>Talks</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>Where Worship Fits:</strong> What place does worship play in the life of a Christian? What is worship? These are critical questions to ask and answer today. (1 Peter 2:4-5)<br>
									<span class="fa fa-youtube-play"></span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et17sMRyO4c" target="_blank">Session 1 Video</a> <span class="fa fa-desktop" style="margin-left:2em"></span> <a href="uploads/1%20Where%20Worship%20Fits.ppsx" target="_blank">Session 1 Slides</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>The God we Worship:</strong> Worship is a response to God&rsquo;s self-revelation. But what is God like? Our perception of God has an enormous influence on how we live and worship. (Exodus 20:3-6; 1 Thessalonians 1:9-10)<br>
									<span class="fa fa-youtube-play"></span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xY-SH0GZzs" target="_blank">Session 2 Video</a> <span class="fa fa-desktop" style="margin-left:2em"></span> <a href="uploads/2%20The%20God%20we%20Worship.ppsx" target="_blank">Session 2 Slides</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>The Difference Jesus Makes:</strong> Jesus himself is the truest worshipper that has ever lived. What influence does his life and work make on the way we worship God? (Mark 1:35-39; Hebrews 10:19-22)<br>
									<span class="fa fa-youtube-play"></span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ-VVJcOuyQ" target="_blank">Session 3 Video</a> <span class="fa fa-desktop" style="margin-left:2em"></span> <a href="uploads/3%20The%20Difference%20Jesus%20Makes.ppsx" target="_blank">Session 3 Slides</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Private, Family and Corporate Worship:</strong> How does our understanding of worship influence these three traditionally accepted forms of worship? Are they still valid and important for us today? (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; Matthew 6:5-6; Psalm 22:22-24)<br>
